## Storyline

Vul volgende elementen in, deze zullen dezelfde zijn voor iedereen in de groep. Zet een "!" naast het deel dat jij hebt gedaan en "!!" naast het element dat je dynamisch maakte

1. (status quo) The human race abandoned earth 1250 years ago. The main reason is because the humans made a nuclear bomb that contained radioactive waves. It finally exploded and caused many deaths. It was such a big explosion that it nearly erased humanity. Humans were not the only victims. Animals and insects were also almost going extinct. However, there were still survivors that escaped the radioactive waves by leaving the planet with a spaceship. Those were the ONLY survivors. (sike)

In the spaceship, there are 6 communities.

The 1st one is the wise ones. They know everything about biology, geography, and history. They are very clever.

Then we have the 2nd one. The warriors. They have been training since their childhood to become stronger and they are made to fight. They are unbeatable.

Then we have the 3rd community. The computer legends. They are very good with technology and also hacking.

The 4th community is about archery and silently killing people. Just like assassins.

The 5th ones are medics. They can heal almost any kind of wounds and they are one of the most important communities in the spaceship. The reason is because people get sick easily due to lack of vitamins.

Then at last, we have the civilians. They are just random people. Some of them are great artists, some singers, some footballers, cooks, gamers, and some just talentless humans. They just live a normal life.

The communities must respect each other, if someone doesn’t respect or obey the rules, they go to jail for 3 months straight.

2. (Call to adventure) The leader of the spaceship wants to check if earth is habitable again after 200 years. He realizes that the people are getting iller than before and they need a habitable planet. He suggests that a group of volunteers check the planet earth. The issue is that no one volunteers, except for our main hero! His name is Mario!

3. (Guidance) Obviously, everybody is afraid of going there. Some say that the suit won’t protect against the radioactive waves, some say that there might be aliens that came to take over the world. Some say that the dinosaurs might be back! However, that won’t stop the leader’s decision. He chose 5 other members from each community.

4. (Crossing) They finally board the ship that will drop them on earth. On the ship, they get to know each other more. The person from the normal district is an ordinary gamer. He is also our main protagonist. Each member has their own supplies. They have high tech weapons that fire lasers. The archer has a special quiver that shoots laser arrows with longer distances.

When they finally arrive, they realize that everywhere has become very green. Not as they expected. Also, there are animals that even the smartest member can’t seem to decipher what they are. Due to the radioactive waves, many animals have evolved into something else. There are for example 1 meter tall cats that have tails like a squirrel and ears like a fox. After walking and exploring, they have discovered another biome that has glowy plants that glow in the night. It seems like even nature has evolved in different ways. Throughout their journey, they will face many dangerous, different animals and biomes. The smartass collects different elements throughout his adventure such as crystals, earth, sand and more for experiments and gathering information about them.

5. (Trials) Throughout their journey, they will face many dangerous animals and biomes. There will be poisonous plants and animals that would like to kill the members. For example: mosquitoes as big as a cat.

6. (Approach !!) After a while, they face a monster that looks like aliens. They have massive crab claws, beaks like pelicans but with sharp teeth, a torso like a human, legs like a kangaroo and feet like lizards. They are 3 meters tall and purple colored. They dislike humans so they attack the 6 members. The members succeeded in escaping their death.

They also got attacked by a group of people that survived the radioactive waves by using only suits. They don’t have advanced technological weapons unlike the 6 members, but they easily outnumbered the 6 heroes and made them surrender. They got brought unconsciously to the unknown group’s hideout. They talk and tell each other's point of views and they become allies. Together, they are going to fight the monsters that try to destroy humanity on earth.

7. (Crisis) They got attacked by the monsters unexpectedly and many people died. Good thing that none of the 6 members died. However, they are badly injured. They can’t win the battle!

8. (Victory) Minutes later, backup from the space civilization has arrived to help fight the monsters. They eventually win the battle!

9. (Return) The 6 members return to their spaceship.

10. (Reward) They all rank up at their community, they get notified that earth is habitable! Little did they know that their best reward is friendship!

11. (New life) People are going back to earth after their preparations are done. Humanity will start a new life at their ancestor’s home again.

12. (Resolution !) The space civilization is going to provide food and supplies for the earth civilization. They will help and support each other’s needs.

13. (new status quo) Everyone will live together, and the people that live on the planet are going to join communities by doing exams. Physical or on paper. It all depends on the community. They will all live happily together.

## Experience

I used red light to show people that it is dangerous.

## Interaction

My interaction was a microphone where the user had to talk to trigger something. The interaction was not that clear.
